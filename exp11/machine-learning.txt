Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. It enables computers to improve through experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Common machine learning techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers.
