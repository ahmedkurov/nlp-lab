Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases. Global warming is one aspect of climate change characterized by rising average temperatures. Effects include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and shifts in wildlife populations and habitats.
