Nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining good health. A balanced diet includes proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals in appropriate amounts. Whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains provide essential nutrients that support bodily functions. Proper nutrition can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Dietary needs vary based on age, sex, lifestyle, and health conditions. Hydration is also an important aspect of nutrition.
