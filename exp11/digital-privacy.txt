Digital privacy concerns the protection of personal information in the digital world. As technology advances, more personal data is collected, stored, and analyzed by companies and governments. Issues include data breaches, unauthorized surveillance, targeted advertising, and the right to be forgotten. Privacy policies, encryption, two-factor authentication, and privacy-focused browsers are tools that can help protect digital privacy. Legislation like GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California aim to give users more control over their personal data.
